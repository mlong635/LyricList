# LyricList

[LyricList](https://LyricList.herokuapp.com) Write, analyze, save, and email your song lyrics all in one easy-to-use cloud-based platform.

## About the App

Inspiration can hit us at the most inopportune times.  Whether on your morning commute, out with friends, or at the office, you can now use LyricList to keep track of all your song lyrics and ideas.

Instead of relying on your imperfect memory, or writing them down on a small piece of paper that might get lost, or waiting until you get back to your home computer or journal, you can now monitor all of your song lyrics and ideas and access them anywhere.  

Need someone to review your lyrics?  Or perhaps send them to a loved one?  You can email your song lyrics directly from the app with just two clicks (and a correct email address).
